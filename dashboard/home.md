### Tokens

Tokens area way to measure words processed by Carter Agents.&#x20;

1 Token = 1 word processed by an Agent.&#x20;

The 'Tokens Left' counter on the dashboard tells you how many remaining tokens you have available and 'Tokens Used' tracks usage.&#x20;

To get more tokens, simply click 'Get More Tokens' to be redirected to a payment page. Once you have paid, the new allotment of Tokens will be added to your account

### Blank Agent

This is button to create a new Agent from scratch. You will be prompted to create a name for your Agent (You can change this later) and once chosen, your Agent will be listed under the 'Agents' tab on the left-hand menu.&#x20;

Important to note that if you have never configured an Agent before, clicking the Agent tab won't show anything in the dropdown, as it is essentially returning an empty list of Agents.&#x20;

Create a new Agent from scratch, or take one of the prebuilt Templates, give it a name and hit 'Next'. Now you will see your shiny new Agent awaiting configuration under the 'Agents" tab.

### Templates

We're configuring some Carter Agents for you, which you can integrate into your projects out of the box (soon to be released).&#x20;

These currently consist of 'Crew commander', 'Assistant' and 'companion' trained agents and we will be continuously configuring new Agent templates to add to the roster.
