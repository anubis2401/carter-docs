# Getting Started

### What is Carter?

Carter is a platform for developers to create and configure conversational digital personalities (called 'Agents'), to integrate into their projects. Developers can give each Carter Agent a unique personality and back story tailored to their specific use case, be it for a game, product or personal hobby project.

### What can I use Carter for?

Carter has an unlimited number of potential use cases which will only grow over time. Some of the favourites include digital companionship platforms, conversational NPCs for immersive gameplay, mental health & depression support, virtual assistants and virtual & augmented reality applications.
