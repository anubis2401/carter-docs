# Pricing (Beta)

_Disclaimer: The following pricing is only for the Beta stage of Carter. Pricing may change for the official product launch._

### How does Carter charge?

We charge based on Token usage (learn about Tokens [<mark style="color:purple;">here</mark>](../dashboard/home.md#tokens)).&#x20;

Upon sign up, each user is given 5,000 free Tokens to use across all Agents. When you run out of Tokens, you are able to buy more via the 'Get More' button on Dashboard Home page. For the beta release, we are keeping things simple and **pricing a bundle of 15,000 Tokens at Â£9.**
